##Introduction
###What is reddit?
Reddit is the engine that powers https://reddit.com, a community-focused online bulletin board system where registered users can post content, such as text, videos, photos or links. Users can then vote submissions up or down influencing it's rank in the overall standings. The most popular content appears on the **Frontpage** where it can be seen by all reddit's users (reddit.com/r/all). 

Reddit's content is divided into **subreddits**, smaller portions of reddit whose purpose is to organized the different content entries according to it's category or area of interest, such as news, movies, music, gaming, food and many others.

###What is reddit's purpose?
>The front page of the Internet - Reddit's slogan

Reddit is the 31st most visited website globally according to **Alexa**, a company specialized in providing web traffic data and analytics.

Due to it's huge user base reddit, reddit's frontpage shows the current most popular content on the internet at that specific the moment in time.

Even though reddit is one of the most reliable source of news on the Internet, the strength of the website is based on the fact that it's customisable. Users may subscribe and unsubscribe different subreddits and, when they visit their own front page, they are greeted with the most upvoted posts from the subreddits they subscribed, unlike reddit.com/r/all, that shows the most upvoted posts from all of reddit.

##Project Model
Although we couldn't contact any of the current developers, after analyzing several commits and mostly [/r/changelog](https://reddit.com/r/changelog) we came to the conclusion that reddit is based on the Incremental Development and Delivery process. The core of the website is already done and it has only suffered a few tweaks throughout the years. However, the rest of the changes that have been made are mostly bug fixes, security updates and the addition of new features. These features are mostly suggested and created by the community through the use of the subreddit [/r/ideasfortheadmins/](https://reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins). Each new feature has been evaluated by the users of the website, as the reviewers are also members.
